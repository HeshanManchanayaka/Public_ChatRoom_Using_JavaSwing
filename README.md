The Public Chat Room Application is a Java-based program enabling real-time communication among users via individual chat windows. Developed using Java Swing, it features a user-friendly interface and allows dynamic user addition through an "Add Sender" option. Messages sent by one user are broadcast to all others, ensuring seamless communication. The ChatController class manages message distribution and maintains all active chat windows.

Key features include:
    Dynamic User Addition  
    Real-Time Message Broadcasting
    Multi-Window Interface
    
This project highlights skills in Java Swing for GUI development and OOP for managing functionality, making it an efficient chat solution.
